# 🚚 LeRoi Delivery -  Frontend 
LeRoi Delivery is built for a personnal delivery service I am starting to run in Rossland, BC.  I wanted a simple site built with React.  I have reused some libraries I am comfortable with such as MUI, Framer-motion, Tailwind, Formik, and Emailjs.  I may add a video in the banner in the future when I find a suitable one.
